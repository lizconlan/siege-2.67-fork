*** HP-UX: the connection keep-alive  directive does not work well

*** Solaris: the connection keep-alive  directive does not work well
    on this platform at this time;  also note:  on solaris you  MUST 
    edit include/joedog/joepath.h BEFORE compiling siege.

*** Siege returns *ALL* cookies regardless of their path; it doesn't 
    store path information.

*** Siege https does not work with proxies; 

*** On AIX,  the native compiler is supported.  It currently doesn't 
    work with gcc, appears to be a linking issue. 

*** Support for clients  > 1000 is limited on most platforms without 
    OS tweaking on the part of the  end user.  Start with a  smaller 
    number (100) and work your way up....
