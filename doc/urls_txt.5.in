.SH INTRODUCTION
.LP
The urls.txt file is installed by default in SIEGE_HOME/etc/urls.txt.  When siege is invoked without a command line reference to a URL, then by default it looks for urls in that file.  The advantage of using the urls.txt file is two-fold: One, it frees you free retyping a url with every invocation.  And two, it allows you to conduct full site regression testing.

When the urls.txt file is used, siege reads all the urls in that file into memory and runs through the list in one of two ways, sequentially or randomly. The default run is sequential from start to finish and back again until the --reps or the --time option has been satisfied.  With the -i/--internet option selected, siege runs through the file randomly simulating the stress applied by a community of internet users. \fR
.br
 \fR
The -f/--file option allows you to select a file other then the default urls.txt file. You may also instruct siege to use a different file with the "file" directive in .siegerc, i.e., "file = /usr/local/etc/urls.txt"\fR
.br
\fR
You may set and reference variables inside the urls.txt file. All variables must be declared BEFORE they are referenced. Variables are declared with the "=" operator, VARIABLE = VALUE. They are then referenced inside $() or ${}, example: $(HOST), ${HOST}\fR

HOST = joey.joedog.org\fR
